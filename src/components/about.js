        Back in early 2024, I decided to venture into the world of frontend
        development and design, adding a new dimension to my backend engineering
        skills. Fast-forward to today, and I'm passionately exploring how to
        combine powerful backend systems with visually stunning, user-friendly
        interfaces. Though I'm still a beginner in frontend and design, I'm
        excited about the journey ahead and eager to master this new frontier.

        I enjoy discovering innovative methods to develop seamless user
        experiences using clean, efficient, and scalable code. I view work as a
        continuous learning journey and am constantly seeking opportunities to
        collaborate with individuals who are as eager to share their knowledge
        as I am to learn. At the end of the day, my main objective is to create
        something beautiful alongside people who inspire me to excel.
